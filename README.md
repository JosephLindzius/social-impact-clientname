##ARTificium vzw & Presence on the Web

I created this remake because I had the honor of playing music at one of the events at this artist group did in the Rivierenhof.  At that moment I only recently began with webdesign at [BeCode](BeCode.org).  When I was directed to their [website](http://www.artificium.be/) I thought immediately that I could help bring more life into the design and enjoyment of art.  Though this is a rough draft of the current site, I feel it carries the character and better displays the most important information.  Please note that **Dutch** is not my first language but I do enjoy working in this language
